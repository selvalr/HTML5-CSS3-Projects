            <h2>Section one</h2>
            <p>The natural world has been one of the recurring subjects of poetry, frequently the primary one, in every
                age and every country. Yet we cannot easily define nature, which, as Gary Snyder points out in his
                preface to No Nature (1992), “will not fulfill our conceptions or assumptions” and “will dodge our
                expectations and theoretical models.” Yet the urge to describe the natural world — its various
                landscapes, its changing seasons, its surrounding phenomena — has been an inescapable part of the
                history of poetry. Wendell Berry provides a simple useful definition of nature poetry as poetry that
                “considers nature as subject matter and inspiration.”

            <p>Our concepts of nature are relative, historically determined. The nature poem is affected by ideology, by
                literary conventions as well as social and cultural ideas. Raymond Williams contends, “Nature is perhaps
                the most complex word in the language.” The term nature is itself contested now because it seems to
                assume an oversimplified relationship between the human and the environment. “Nature” has been the site
                of so many different naïve symbolisms, such as purity, escape, and savagery. That’s why poets and
                critics often refer to green poetry or environmental poetry, which presupposes a complicated
                interconnection between nature and humankind.

                James Thomson, the first important eighteenth-century nature poet, infused his lovingly detailed
                descriptions in The Seasons (1730) with his age’s sense of God’s sustaining presence in nature. As he
                writes in “Spring”: “Chief, lovely spring, in thee, and thy soft scenes / The SMILING GOD is seen; while
                water, earth / And air attest his bounty.” Alexander Pope leads his “Essay on Criticism” (1711) with the
                rule, “First follow Nature.” For him, “following nature” means honoring classical precedent: “Learn
                hence for Ancient Rules a just Esteem; / To copy Nature is to copy Them.” Pope describes these rules as
                “Nature Methodiz’d.” Writing at a time when English society was being transformed from an agricultural
                society to an industrial one, the romantic poets treated nature in a groundbreaking way, dwelling in its
                localities, praising its nurturing powers, spiritualizing it. Think of these summary lines from William
                Wordsworth’s defining nature poem, “Tintern Abbey” (1798):
